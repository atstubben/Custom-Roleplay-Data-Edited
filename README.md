# Custom-Roleplay-Data-Edited
Based on the datapack by MukiTanuki https://modrinth.com/datapack/custom-roleplay-data

This datapack has two commands:
/trigger CustomModelData set <NUMBER>
  This command will attempt to apply the CustomModelData component of a specified number (must be greater than 0) to the item in your hand.
  Each number can be assigned CustomModelData via a resource pack. An example is provided: atstubben/Custom-Roleplay-Data-Edited/StubbsCustoms.zip

/trigger CustomModelDataRemove
  This command will remove all CustomModelData from the item in your hand.

INSTALLATION:
Place the 'custom_roleplay_data' datapack in the 'datapacks' folder of your world.
Download a working resource pack and place it in your resourcepacks folder. Example pack https://github.com/atstubben/StubbsCustoms
Enjoy!

CUSTOMIZATION:
If you are new to resource packs, feel free to unzip the example pack and check out the .json files, you should be able to replace my images with your own if you just want basic stuff.
